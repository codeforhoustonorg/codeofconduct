The Code for Houston Brigade (https://codeforhouston.org) asks all participants and stakeholders to abide by the following Code of Conduct:

1. Create a safe and respectful environment for all participants, where people are free from discrimination or harassment.
2. Create a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Respect the value of others: Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Encourage questions and don’t assume everyone has the same context.
5. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as — or even more than — they speak.
6. Create ways for people to contribute productively with their skills and energy. Use additive language such as “yes/and” as opposed to destructive language like “no/but.”
7. Strive to build tools that are open and solutions that anyone can use. Activities that aim to foster public benefit over private profit are prioritized.
8. Design and develop solutions with input from and access for those who are often excluded from the civic process.
9. Ensure that the community's diversity is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, people of color, ethnic minorities, the lgbtq+ community, people from different generations and abilities, and other marginalized groups.
10. Actively involve mission-aligned stakeholders and those with subject matter expertise; and ensure that relationships and conversations among community members, local government, and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.

The Code for Houston Brigade reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of this Code of Conduct to leave and/or not participate in any Code for Houston activities, events, and digital forums. To report anyone in violation locally, please contact the Impact Hub Houston team at **houston** at **impacthub.net**

This Code of Conduct is based on several other guides, including the Code for America Code of Conduct; the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher; and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.

All Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.

In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Code for America will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Zg2FDt7awgfCmdcbzMwKHMb1A7KDOhs_z7ibCb3TLLQ/edit">see this guide</a>.

Code for America is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Code for America event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can contact them at [EVENT ORGANIZER/FORUM ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER]. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.

You can also contact Code for America about harassment by emailing **safespace** at **codeforamerica.org** and feel free to use the email template below. Code for America staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.

We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
